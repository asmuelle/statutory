## just Recipes

| Recipe | What it does | When to run |
|---|---|---|
| `just` | Lists all recipes | Orientation |
| `just setup` | `corepack enable` + `pnpm install` | After clone / lockfile change |
| `just dev` | `pnpm dev` — Next.js app + Inngest dev server | Daily development |
| `just db-up` | `docker compose up -d postgres` (pgvector/pgvector:pg16, host port **5434**) | Before dev/test needing DB |
| `just db-down` | Stops the Postgres container | Cleanup |
| `just migrate` | Applies `packages/db/drizzle` migrations (no-op + warning without `DATABASE_URL`); generate new ones with `pnpm --filter @statutory/db generate` | After schema changes, after pull |
| `just test` | `pnpm test` (Vitest, workspace-wide; **no database needed**) | Before every commit; in TDD loop |
| `just test-db` | DB trust-gate integration suite (`vitest.db.config.ts`, `packages/db/src/*.dbtest.ts`); **requires `DATABASE_URL`**, fails fast with instructions otherwise | After `just db-up && just migrate`; runs in GitHub CI against the service container |
| `just e2e` | `pnpm e2e` → Playwright (chromium only) against the review queue + rulebook; starts/stops its own `next dev` on port 3902 | Before PR; after UI/flow changes |
| `just lint` | `pnpm lint` (ESLint) | Before commit (hook also auto-fixes) |
| `just format` | `pnpm format` (Prettier write) | Rarely needed manually (hook formats) |
| `just typecheck` | `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) | Before commit |
| `just build` | `pnpm build` | Before PR; verifies prod build |
| `just ci` | lint → typecheck → test → build | The gate. Must be green before commit |

All recipes print a helpful failure message and exit 1 until the workspace is
bootstrapped (no `package.json` yet — see DESIGN.md M0).

## Required Env Vars

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection (local: docker compose; CI: service container) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Triage + synthesis model calls |
| `GOVINFO_API_KEY` | GovInfo bulk data (api.data.gov key) |
| `REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY` | Regulations.gov v4 (api.data.gov key) |
| `OPENSTATES_API_KEY` | OpenStates v3 state-legislation sync |
| `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` | CourtListener REST API |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Transactional email + alert digests |
| `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` / `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` | Pipeline scheduling (prod; dev server needs none) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Billing (M3 only) |

Keep a committed `.env.example` with names only. Validate presence at startup; fail fast.

## Local Services

- **Postgres 16 + pgvector** via `docker compose` (`pgvector/pgvector:pg16`), started
  with `just db-up` on **host port 5434** (chosen to avoid collisions with other local
  Postgres instances; `DATABASE_URL=postgres://statutory:statutory@localhost:5434/statutory_dev`).
  Owns versioned rulebook sections, effective-date history, profiles, review queue, and
  embeddings for the topic taxonomy. Migration `0002_trust_gate.sql` installs the M2
  trust triggers: deltas cannot gain `published_at` unless gate-verified with every
  citation stamped AND the latest review record is `approved`; published deltas,
  `section_versions`, and `review_records` are immutable/append-only at the DB level.
- **Playwright (chromium)** drives `just e2e`: review-queue approve/reject/edit flows
  with a mock reviewer session (httpOnly cookie) plus rulebook provenance/coverage
  checks. One-time setup: `pnpm --filter @statutory/web exec playwright install chromium`.
  Test isolation via `POST /api/test/reset` (disabled in production builds).
- **Inngest dev server** runs inside `just dev` for local cron/step execution.

## CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

- Triggers on `push` and `pull_request`; single job on `ubuntu-latest`.
- Steps: checkout → setup-just → Node 22 + corepack → **bootstrap guard** → install → `just ci`.
- **Bootstrap guard:** if `package.json` is absent, the job emits a notice and skips
  install/build steps — the docs-only scaffold stays green. Once M0 lands, the full
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` + `just ci` path runs automatically.
- A `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` service container is wired via `DATABASE_URL`; after
  `just ci` the workflow runs `just migrate` + `just test-db` against it, so the
  DB-enforced publish gate is exercised on every push. `just ci` itself never needs
  a database (DB suites live in `vitest.db.config.ts` and skip without `DATABASE_URL`).

## AI Harness Notes (.claude/settings.json)

- **PostToolUse hooks:** Prettier auto-formats every written/edited `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.json/.css/.md`
  file; ESLint `--fix` runs on `.ts/.tsx`. Both are no-ops until `package.json` exists.
- **Stop hook:** `tsc --noEmit` runs at session end (once bootstrapped) — type errors
  surface even if you forgot `just typecheck`.
- **Permissions:** `just`, `pnpm`, `node`, `npx vitest`, `npx playwright`,
  `docker compose`, and read-only git are pre-allowed.
- **Useful subagents:** `planner` before any multi-file feature; `tdd-guide` for new
  pipeline stages (verification gate work especially); `code-reviewer` after every
  change set; `security-reviewer` for anything touching user profiles, Slack webhooks,
  exports, or billing; `build-error-resolver` when `just ci` breaks.
